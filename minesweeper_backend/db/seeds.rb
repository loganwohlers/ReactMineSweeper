# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)


# User.destroy_all
# Game.destroy_all
#
# user1 = User.create(username: 'Claire')
# user2 = User.create(username: 'Kristen')
# user3 = User.create(username: 'Molly')
# user4 = User.create(username: 'Jesse')
#
# game1 = Game.create(user: user1, difficulty: 'Beginner', score: 20)
# game2 = Game.create(user: user3, difficulty: 'Beginner', score: 30)
# game3 = Game.create(user: user2, difficulty: 'Beginner', score: 50)
# game4 = Game.create(user: user1, difficulty: 'Beginner', score: 10)
# game5 = Game.create(user: user4, difficulty: 'Beginner', score: 10)
